# Learning a Tun

Finally figured out that at its base, without much config, the tun created by
the lib will use 10.0.0.1 as a gateway to 10.0.0.255.
Except nc will only work if you're sending to 10.0.0.255.
Possibly because of skipping some routes, but fixed with the `destination`
argument to the builder.
But I can now make an echoing IP device that works with netcat.

To make the library a bit cleaner, I think it makes sense if a Tunnel
encapsulates not just the wireguard part, but also the tun/tap part since that's
basically the net interface to the wireguard portion.

I'll still need to build some sort of "protocol" here for one end being a server
and the other being able to talk to to it and request a file.

I'm thinking the general flow would be:

1. Hole punch for a UDP Socket
2. That UDP socket gets used in a wireguard tunnel
3. We get a tun device that uses the wireguard tunnel to encapsulate and send
   devices
4. Need a whole freaking protocol on top of this. I'll figure that out later.

Also learning that a boringtun::Tunn is incredibly _passive_, e.g. it does no
sending of its own, which is kinda great.
It simply lets you encapsulate and decapsulate at will, the network device will
still have to do the heavy lifting.
